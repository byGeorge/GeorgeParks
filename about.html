      It's just a small demo to show that I have an understanding of these languages. I'm also familiar with
      JQuery, Bootstrap, and other frontend frameworks, but this was such a small project that it didn't make
      sense to add any libraries.</dd>

      I don't find Java particularly useful. It does do everything, but it doesn't do anything particularly well.
      It's included because Java is still very much alive in the coding world. Far as I can tell, Spring is the
      most used framework.</dd>

      This code is pretty old, but it was a fun project to do. It was my senior project for my BS in
      Computer Science.</dd>
